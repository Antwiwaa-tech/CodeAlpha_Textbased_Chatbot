You got something on love...\n\nIn the quiet hum of twilight’s breath,\nTwo souls met beneath moonlit depth.\nNot by fate, nor destined line,\nBut by whispers soft, in notes divine.\n\nShe spoke in laughter, he in rhyme,\nEach moment danced beyond all time.\nYet seasons turned, the leaves would fall,\nBut love stood strong, above them all.\n\nNo promises carved in stone or thread,\nYet love endured, though words were dead.\nFor echoes live where hearts have been,\nAnd love is felt, though left unseen."

'For the girl who always stops but never comes in.'\n\nMara, for the first time, stepped inside."
